// Day 1 final project â€“ Guess the Number Game but with some unique twists:

// Limited attempts (like 7 chances).
// Hints after every wrong guess ("Too high!" / "Too low!").
// At the end, show score: number of attempts taken.
// If the player fails, reveal the secret number.
// Add a "Play Again" option.




use rand::Rng; // this comes from the rand crate (a library)
// Rng is a trait that provides methods for generating random numbers
use std::cmp::Ordering; // this brings the ordering enum into scope 
// Ordering can be: less, greater, or equal
// we use it when comparing two values with .cmp()
use std::io;

// external crates 

// a "crate" in rust = a library or package of code
// rust has a standard library (like std::io, std::cmp), which comes built-in
// but you can also use external crates made by others, published on crates.io
// eg:
// rand (for random numbers)
// serde (for serialization, like JSON handling)
// tokio (for async programming)

// enums

// "enum" = one type, many possible forms (like multiple choices)
// useful when you want a variable to represent different possible states
// eg in real life
// traffic light = red, yellow, green
// payment mode = cash, card, UPI


//External crate = library you bring in from outside (like rand).
//Enum = a custom type with multiple possible forms (good for state handling).
